What does this script do ?

2. Win+L Locks system and turns off monitor
3. Ctrl+Alt+C in Explorer, Opens a command prompt with the current folder

---------------------------
But Why ?
---------------------------
I work with multiple monitors at home and work. When I want to leave the desk for some time, previously I used to lock the screen and then manually shut the monitor. However, with multiple screens this becomes a little difficult. At such times the combination Win+L is useful as it does lock the system and turns off all the monitors.

Also in cases when I am away for few minutes only, I don't want to re login into the system again. So I just use the Ctrl + . combination to temporarily turn off the screens for some time. When mouse is moved, the screens turn back on.

How to run script ?
---------------------------
1. Download "AutoHotkey.exe" from my github repo. (It is present one folder up from current directory)
2. Download "screenOff.ahk" from this folder
3. Place both files in a single directory.
4. Drag and drop "screenOff.ahk" onto "AutoHotkey.exe". 
5. You can now start using ths shortcuts
6. On system restart, you just need to perform "Step 4" once again.

NOTE: This script works with any number monitors.
